        review: "This was my first read by Liane Moriarty, and I loved it. I can’t wait to dive into her other stories, which is luckily quite a few. I admire her writing style, especially her sharp and astute observations of people and their flaws. Even though the storyline is a mystery, you stay to read about the life of the characters. “Apples never fall” is a mystery novel following the Delaney family before and after Joy Delaney, beloved wife and mother of four, disappeared. Her four grown-up children, Amy, Logan, Troy and Brooke, are reluctant to report her missing, because the prime suspect will most likely be their father, Stan. The story also follows Savannah, a stranger who before the disappearance turned up on Stan and Joy’s door, bleeding after a fight with her boyfriend. I really liked that even though this was a mystery, I was never scared or terrified. I was only constantly wondering, where is Joy Delaney? I had to find out and was not able to put the book down. Recommended for anyone in search of an entertaining and amusing story. "

        review: "Murder in Little Egypt is a true crime, telling the story of the unimaginable crime of a father murdering his son. Dr. Cavaness was a well respected doctor living in a small, rural place called Eldorado in Southern Illinois. Despite him being a greedy, drunken, and selfish man, the townpeople of Eldorado worshiped him. He had 4 sons, Mark, Kevin, Sean and Patrick.Murder in Little Egyot is a story of manipulation, hatred, coldness and inhumanity. In the beginning, the reader gets a thourghough introduction to Dr. Cavaness life, long before he murdered his son. I would recommend this book for those interested in true crime. The book is written on a detective and interpersonal level, without too many gory details.",
