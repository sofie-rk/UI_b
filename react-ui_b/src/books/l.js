    review: 'Miles Halter, a little nerd from Florida with a fascination with last words of famous people, has his life turned around when he goes away to Culver Creek Boarding School in Alabama. His roommate, Colonel (aka Chips), takes Miles (which he names Pudge) under his wing, and with his new friends is Miles meeting a life filled with pranks, bullies, girls with boobs, alcohol and cigarettes. He meets Alaska, an utterly fascinating, beautiful, impulsive, sexy, emotionally unstable and crazy girl, and Miles could not be more in love with her. The book is divided into two parts - before Alaska\'s death, and after. This is a well-written teen fiction book by John Green. I believe I tried to read this as a teen myself as it was so popular, but gave up since I still struggled with reading English. When the story reached Alaska\'s death, I understood that if I ever read it all the way through, it must have been before I lost one of my own friends in a car accident in high school, otherwise the story would have left more of an impression on me. It was very special to read about a teen\'s mind when a friend suddenly dies, since I so clearly recall those mourning days myself. I remember the feeling of entering the school, finding all classrooms empty and the entire school gathered in the cafeteria in complete silence. My heart still breaks every time I think of my friends crying around me, unable to know how to handle what for many was the first experience of sudden death and loss. The story, writing-style and characters wasn\'t top-notch reading for me as an adult, but I would recommend the book to teenagers. \'Y\'all smoke to have fun. I smoke to die.\' - Alaska Young',
