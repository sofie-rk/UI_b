    review: 'Unfortunately not the top of the list for me. I will definitely read anything Kamela Harris writes in 10 years or so, but I did not find this book particularly interesting nor good. Harris shares some stories of her personal life, from growing up to studying to getting into politics to meeting her husband etc. However, most of the book is centered around her career, and for a regular non-American person like me is this part too long, too detailed and difficult to follow. I also felt that this book was too long and that the chapters were poorly structured. I will give Harris another chance if she writes other books in the future, as I am sure she has a very interesting and important story to tell.',

    review: 'In "Talking as Fast a I Can", Lauren Graham shares stories about her life growing up, becoming an actress and living in Hollywood. She plays the iconic "Lorelai Gilmore" in the TV-series "Gilmore Girls" which aired for seven seasons between 2000-2007. I was late to the party and watched the show for the first time in 2017. I became obsessively in love with everything about it, and have re-watched the show several times in just a few years. I guess I was in desperate need of something to fill the big Stars-Hollow shaped hole in my life. Unfortunately wasn\'t this book enough to do so. Lauren Graham seems like a wonderful woman, but I couldn\'t help but wanting her to be Lorelai Gilmore instead. Although I enjoyed her reflections on Gilmore Girls and on being Lorelai Gilmore, it was not enough to make this an amazing book. I would easily listen to her for hours telling how it was to do each an every episode, so maybe this book would never contain enough details to make me happy. I\'m glad I read it (I even finished it in 2 days), and I really couldn\'t not read it given how much I love Gilmore Girls.',

    review: 'Invisible women is a collection of statistics enlightening unconscious gender bias. It describes the dangers when systems made by and for men fail at considering women\'s need and habits. The book is eye opening, provoking, incredibly enlightening, and a must-read for EVERYONE. Quotes from the book: "When we are designing a world that is meant to work for everyone we need women in the room." "It begins with how doctors are trained. Historically it\'s been assumed that there wasn\'t anything fundamentally different between male and female bodies other that size and reproductive function, and so for years medical education has been focused on a male \'norm\', with everything that falls outside that designated \'atypical\' or even \'abnormal\'... Anatomy, and female anatomy." "a Finnish study found that single women recovered better from heart attacks than married women - particularly when put alongside a University of Michigan study which found that husbands create an extra seven hours of housework a week for women." "It is abundantly clear that the culture of paid work as a whole needs a radical overhaul. It needs to take into account that women are not the unencumbered workers the traditional workplace has been designed to suit."'
