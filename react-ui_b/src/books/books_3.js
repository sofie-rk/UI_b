    review: 'Invisible women is a collection of statistics enlightening unconscious gender bias. It describes the dangers when systems made by and for men fail at considering women\'s need and habits. The book is eye opening, provoking, incredibly enlightening, and a must-read for EVERYONE. Quotes from the book: "When we are designing a world that is meant to work for everyone we need women in the room." "It begins with how doctors are trained. Historically it\'s been assumed that there wasn\'t anything fundamentally different between male and female bodies other that size and reproductive function, and so for years medical education has been focused on a male \'norm\', with everything that falls outside that designated \'atypical\' or even \'abnormal\'... Anatomy, and female anatomy." "a Finnish study found that single women recovered better from heart attacks than married women - particularly when put alongside a University of Michigan study which found that husbands create an extra seven hours of housework a week for women." "It is abundantly clear that the culture of paid work as a whole needs a radical overhaul. It needs to take into account that women are not the unencumbered workers the traditional workplace has been designed to suit."'
