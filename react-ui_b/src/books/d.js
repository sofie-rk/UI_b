    review: 'Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, one of the most mysterious figures in the Harry Potter series. Here Irvin Khyatman offers an in-depth character analysis, exploring the author\'s and fans various theories and thoughts about the extraordinary man. Whilst I don\'t agree with everything Irvin writes there are some very interesting perspectives, and I felt like the mind-blown emoji through many of the essays. Recommended for Harry Potter fans.',

    review: 'Brandi Glanville offers a hilarious and easy read with this book. She spills the beans about her cheating ex-husband, one-night stands, her wild ride into "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" and the plastic surgery that made her vagina seventeen years old again. I recommend this one for everyone who watches RHOBH, and especially those who struggles with understanding whether they like Brandi or is annoyed by her.',
