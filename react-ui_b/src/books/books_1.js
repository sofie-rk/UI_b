    review: 'Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts, one of the most mysterious figures in the Harry Potter series. Here Irvin Khyatman offers an in-depth character analysis, exploring the author\'s and fans various theories and thoughts about the extraordinary man. Whilst I don\'t agree with everything Irvin writes there are some very interesting perspectives, and I felt like the mind-blown emoji through many of the essays. Recommended for Harry Potter fans.',

    review: "Murder in Little Egypt is a true crime, telling the story of the unimaginable crime of a father murdering his son. Dr. Cavaness was a well respected doctor living in a small, rural place called Eldorado in Southern Illinois. Despite him being a greedy, drunken, and selfish man, the townpeople of Eldorado worshiped him. He had 4 sons, Mark, Kevin, Sean and Patrick.Murder in Little Egyot is a story of manipulation, hatred, coldness and inhumanity. In the beginning, the reader gets a thourghough introduction to Dr. Cavaness life, long before he murdered his son. I would recommend this book for those interested in true crime. The book is written on a detective and interpersonal level, without too many gory details.",
