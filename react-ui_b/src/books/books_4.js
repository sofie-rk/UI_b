    review: 'Not impressed. I read this book after recommendations from audible and goodreads based on my previous true-crime readings and after seeing the good reviews. Unfortunately, this did not enter one of my favorite books. "We Thought We Knew You" is a true story about the murder of Mary Yoder, a chiropractor operating a chiropractic center with her husband Bill.One day she comes home unwell, suddenly vomiting and weak. She dies at the hospital, and it is later discovered that she had been poisoned with colchicine. The story follows Adam Yoder, Bill and Mary\'s son, and his on-and-off girlfriend Kaitlyn Conley, who worked at the chiropractic center with Bill and Mary. Spolier alert: Kaitlyn poisoned Mary. Although the story is truly sad and unreal, I was never shocked by unknown twists. The writing style did also not work well for me. Phelps jumps back and forth in time, and I struggled with understanding the circumstances around all of the fights between Adam and Kaitlyn. It is unnecessary repetitive, and I think it could have been easily shorten to half. Not recommended from my side.',

    review: 'Oh well, where do I start. Even though I consider myself a hard-core Potterhead, I was hesitant to go as far as reading this character analysis of Severus Snape. But I loved it. Snape is a super complex character from the books of Harry Potter, and this book helped me reflect even more reflections about the misunderstood man. I really hope Lorrie Kim writes more books in the future. Anyhow, I will start diving into more character analysis books of Harry Potter characters after this one. Next up is the character analysis of Albus Dumbledore by Irvin Khyatman!',

    review: 'Brandi Glanville offers a hilarious and easy read with this book. She spills the beans about her cheating ex-husband, one-night stands, her wild ride into "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" and the plastic surgery that made her vagina seventeen years old again. I recommend this one for everyone who watches RHOBH, and especially those who struggles with understanding whether they like Brandi or is annoyed by her.',

    review: 'Sheryl Sandberg, a women with an impressive career, currently COO of Facebook, uses this book to talk about women and leadership. There are parts that I liked, and parts that I did not like. Some times I felt that Sandberg was listing up everything that is wrong with women in work, and how we should act more like men to fit into the workplace. However, she is right about a lot of things. Her arguments are backed by other successful business women stories and other research, and there are a lot of good tips to take out from this book. I noticed myself asking more questions, \'sitting at the table\' and believing that I had something to offer after reading this books. Recommended for women who strives to be part of the working elite, but not for the regular women on the street.',
