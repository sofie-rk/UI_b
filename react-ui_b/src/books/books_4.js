    review: 'Oh well, where do I start. Even though I consider myself a hard-core Potterhead, I was hesitant to go as far as reading this character analysis of Severus Snape. But I loved it. Snape is a super complex character from the books of Harry Potter, and this book helped me reflect even more reflections about the misunderstood man. I really hope Lorrie Kim writes more books in the future. Anyhow, I will start diving into more character analysis books of Harry Potter characters after this one. Next up is the character analysis of Albus Dumbledore by Irvin Khyatman!',

    review: 'Sheryl Sandberg, a women with an impressive career, currently COO of Facebook, uses this book to talk about women and leadership. There are parts that I liked, and parts that I did not like. Some times I felt that Sandberg was listing up everything that is wrong with women in work, and how we should act more like men to fit into the workplace. However, she is right about a lot of things. Her arguments are backed by other successful business women stories and other research, and there are a lot of good tips to take out from this book. I noticed myself asking more questions, \'sitting at the table\' and believing that I had something to offer after reading this books. Recommended for women who strives to be part of the working elite, but not for the regular women on the street.',
