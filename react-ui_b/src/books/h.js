    review: 'How to Avoid a Climate Disaster is an interesting and well-informed book where Bill Gates sets out a practical and accessible plan as to how to save our planet from a climate catastrophe. He introduces us to the extent out our environmental problems, where we are now, and what we must do to get to zero greenhouse gas emissions in time. Many would expect this book to be a guide of what each individual should do to, but it is not. At no time is he telling us to stop using electricity, stop driving and flying, or decide we don\'t like eating meat. Instead, he tells us why they lead to climate change and how technology can help us make these activities carbon neutral. The focus is on widespread policy and economics. Bill Gates breaks it down into five activities that emissions come from: making things, producing electricity, agriculture, transportation, and heating/cooling. I found every section to be very informative and interesting, explained in a simple and easy way. This will be a good read for anyone who wants to learn more about climate change. ',
