    review: "This was my first read by Liane Moriarty, and I loved it. I can’t wait to dive into her other stories, which is luckily quite a few. I admire her writing style, especially her sharp and astute observations of people and their flaws. Even though the storyline is a mystery, you stay to read about the life of the characters. “Apples never fall” is a mystery novel following the Delaney family before and after Joy Delaney, beloved wife and mother of four, disappeared. Her four grown-up children, Amy, Logan, Troy and Brooke, are reluctant to report her missing, because the prime suspect will most likely be their father, Stan. The story also follows Savannah, a stranger who before the disappearance turned up on Stan and Joy’s door, bleeding after a fight with her boyfriend. I really liked that even though this was a mystery, I was never scared or terrified. I was only constantly wondering, where is Joy Delaney? I had to find out and was not able to put the book down. Recommended for anyone in search of an entertaining and amusing story. "

    review: "A Rip in Heaven is Jeanine Cummins' story of a horrifying night when her cousins Julie and Robin Kerry and her brother Tom Cummins were brutally assualted. April 4th 1991, Tom, Julie and Robin went for a late-night walk on the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge outside of St. Louis, Missouri.On the bridge, they met Marlin Gray, Antonio Richardson, Reginald Clemsons and Daniel Winfrey, who robbed, assaulted and pushed them from the bridge. A Rip in Heaven is a memoir of a shocking crime and its aftermath. It's impeccably written, and the author does an excellent job of respectfully telling a story that needed to be told. I must say that I truly enjoyed reading the book, and would recommend it to anyone who likes true crime and memoirs.",
