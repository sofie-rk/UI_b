    review: '"Educated" by Tara Westover is one the few books I think everyone should read. It is a memoir about self-innovation and finding your own path, and provide valuable insight into cultural differences and mental illness. Tara was raised in a Mormon survivalist home in Buck Peak, Idaho. Her father believed in conspiracy theories, and the family was preparing for the "Days of Abomination" by hoarding food and guns. He was also suspicious of the government, and believed that his children should be home-schooled and that illness should be treated at home with herbalism rather than at a hospital. Her mother was a midwife and a healer, whom Tara helped from time to time. She also worked in her father\'s junkyard. The family was so isolated from the outside society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara\'s older brothers became violent. Without any formal education, Tara began to educate herself. When she was 17 she got admitted to Brigham Young University (BYU), which opened a completely new world for her. She learned for the first time about important world events like Holocaust, and she met people who showed her that it was ok to take an aspirin if you experience pain, and that accepting money from the government to study is not the same as letting the government take control over you. Her quest for knowledge transformed her, and took her to Harvard and Cambridge. Everyone will at some point in their life go from thinking that your parents know everything to seeing them as adults with limitations. Tara\'s story is an extreme compared to what most people have to go through. It is truly inspiring to see her growth and determination, and that it is possible to tear yourself loose from the future predicted by your childhood. "Educated" is an amazing book, impeccably written, and you sometimes forget that the story is real. A must read for everyone!',
