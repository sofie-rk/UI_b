    review: 'In "Talking as Fast a I Can", Lauren Graham shares stories about her life growing up, becoming an actress and living in Hollywood. She plays the iconic "Lorelai Gilmore" in the TV-series "Gilmore Girls" which aired for seven seasons between 2000-2007. I was late to the party and watched the show for the first time in 2017. I became obsessively in love with everything about it, and have re-watched the show several times in just a few years. I guess I was in desperate need of something to fill the big Stars-Hollow shaped hole in my life. Unfortunately wasn\'t this book enough to do so. Lauren Graham seems like a wonderful woman, but I couldn\'t help but wanting her to be Lorelai Gilmore instead. Although I enjoyed her reflections on Gilmore Girls and on being Lorelai Gilmore, it was not enough to make this an amazing book. I would easily listen to her for hours telling how it was to do each an every episode, so maybe this book would never contain enough details to make me happy. I\'m glad I read it (I even finished it in 2 days), and I really couldn\'t not read it given how much I love Gilmore Girls.',

    review: 'Unfortunately not the top of the list for me. I will definitely read anything Kamela Harris writes in 10 years or so, but I did not find this book particularly interesting nor good. Harris shares some stories of her personal life, from growing up to studying to getting into politics to meeting her husband etc. However, most of the book is centered around her career, and for a regular non-American person like me is this part too long, too detailed and difficult to follow. I also felt that this book was too long and that the chapters were poorly structured. I will give Harris another chance if she writes other books in the future, as I am sure she has a very interesting and important story to tell.',

    review: 'I cannot understand the hype around this book. I got it recommended everywhere, it is a New York Times best seller and with endless good reviews, but this does not fall under the category a \'must-read\' from me. The story follows siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy over five decades, from living in the impressing \'Dutch House\' to being thrown into poverty by their step-mother Andrea when their father dies. Even though the story line did not hit me as particularly interesting, it leaves a strong message about how much the decisions we make affect others. Maybe I should listen to this book one more time to see if it was just too complicated for me for a single read.',

    review: 'Wow, what a book! This is my second book by Liane Moriarty, and it did not disappoint. \'The Husband\'s Secret\' is a hilarious, mysterious and thought-provoking novel about how well we know our spouses - and, ultimately, ourselves. Let me start with the sentences that drew my attention to this book in the first place: "Imagine that your husband wrote you a letter, to be opened after his death. Imagine, too, that the letter contains his deepest, darkest secret - something with the potential to destroy not just the life you built together, but the lives of others as well. Imagine, then, that you stumble across that letter while your husband is still very much alive..." Alluring, isn\'t it? We follow three story lines, which gives the book a fairly slow start, but it grows addictive when you know the characters and their circumstances. You wonder; what is the husband\'s secret? How bad could it possibly be? And how are these three story lines connected? The first and primary story is about Cecilia Fitzpatrick, a devoted wife and mother, and a pillar of her small community. Her life is seemingly orderly and spotless, until she finds a letter hidden in a shoe box in the attic. Next story line is about Tess, who flees to Sydney with her son when she finds out that her husband has fallen in love with her best friend (who also happens to be her cousin). Then there is Rachel, an older women, still struggling with grief and rage after her daughter was found murdered in a park a few decades ago. Without spoiling anything, I must say that the \'secret\' isn\'t really a mystery or particularly exciting, and its reveal is a bit anti-climatic. What floats this book is the characters and Liane Moriarty\'s excellent writing style. The dialogue and dynamics between the characters are funny and entertaining, and the author is able to express those rare pieces of human honesty - little thoughts, feelings and behaviors that are personal and strange, yet instantly recognizable. Recommended for everyone who needs an entertaining novel!',

    review: '"The Perks of Being a Wallflower" follows Charlie, a shy, socially awkward, yet intelligent boy beyond his years. The story follows him through freshman year of high school, where he tries to navigate through a wide variety of feelings, new friends and tons of books. I think this can be considered a \'classic\' and a \'must-read\' within the Young Adult genre. Charlie shows that being different is ok, and that you can find friends in all sort of packages.',
