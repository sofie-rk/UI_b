    review: 'I cannot understand the hype around this book. I got it recommended everywhere, it is a New York Times best seller and with endless good reviews, but this does not fall under the category a \'must-read\' from me. The story follows siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy over five decades, from living in the impressing \'Dutch House\' to being thrown into poverty by their step-mother Andrea when their father dies. Even though the story line did not hit me as particularly interesting, it leaves a strong message about how much the decisions we make affect others. Maybe I should listen to this book one more time to see if it was just too complicated for me for a single read.',

    review: 'Wow, what a book! This is my second book by Liane Moriarty, and it did not disappoint. \'The Husband\'s Secret\' is a hilarious, mysterious and thought-provoking novel about how well we know our spouses - and, ultimately, ourselves. Let me start with the sentences that drew my attention to this book in the first place: "Imagine that your husband wrote you a letter, to be opened after his death. Imagine, too, that the letter contains his deepest, darkest secret - something with the potential to destroy not just the life you built together, but the lives of others as well. Imagine, then, that you stumble across that letter while your husband is still very much alive..." Alluring, isn\'t it? We follow three story lines, which gives the book a fairly slow start, but it grows addictive when you know the characters and their circumstances. You wonder; what is the husband\'s secret? How bad could it possibly be? And how are these three story lines connected? The first and primary story is about Cecilia Fitzpatrick, a devoted wife and mother, and a pillar of her small community. Her life is seemingly orderly and spotless, until she finds a letter hidden in a shoe box in the attic. Next story line is about Tess, who flees to Sydney with her son when she finds out that her husband has fallen in love with her best friend (who also happens to be her cousin). Then there is Rachel, an older women, still struggling with grief and rage after her daughter was found murdered in a park a few decades ago. Without spoiling anything, I must say that the \'secret\' isn\'t really a mystery or particularly exciting, and its reveal is a bit anti-climatic. What floats this book is the characters and Liane Moriarty\'s excellent writing style. The dialogue and dynamics between the characters are funny and entertaining, and the author is able to express those rare pieces of human honesty - little thoughts, feelings and behaviors that are personal and strange, yet instantly recognizable. Recommended for everyone who needs an entertaining novel!',

    review: '"The Perks of Being a Wallflower" follows Charlie, a shy, socially awkward, yet intelligent boy beyond his years. The story follows him through freshman year of high school, where he tries to navigate through a wide variety of feelings, new friends and tons of books. I think this can be considered a \'classic\' and a \'must-read\' within the Young Adult genre. Charlie shows that being different is ok, and that you can find friends in all sort of packages.',
