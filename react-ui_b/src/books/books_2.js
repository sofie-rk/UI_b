    review: 'I was not a big Stassi fan after her first appearances on Vanderpump Rules. Although I grew to like her eventually, I did not expect to enjoy her book as much as I did. As the book title implies, this book is about embracing being basic a.f. A basic bitch loves all things Starbucks, selfies, social media, hot dogs, bubbly cocktails, #OOTD, millennial pink... The list goes on and on. Basically, she covers every imaginable basic subject. Stassi is bright, witty and authentic. It is easy entertainment, and I must shamefully admit that I enjoyed each and every part of it. What I love the most about the book, though, is how empowering it is. When Stassi tells you to be basic a.f. she means that you should embrace being yourself. Find your own style, learn from your mistakes, and find the people that love and support you. One of the last things she tells you before finishing the book is this: "Think of times you have felt your happiest, and make a list of them. And then take some time to think about why you were happy. Yes, sometimes it will be because you were with loved ones or it was your 21st birthday or your son was born. But a lot of them will be simply because you were yourself. And you would not having to pretend to be a foodie who despises hotdogs or a TV hater who would never watch Kardashians, even though you watch it on the reg. Look to those moments and aspire to keep those moments going. And that\'s what makes you an enlightened next level basic bitch badass."',

    review: 'Lala Kent is known from the reality series "Vanderpump Rules". In a collection of essays, Lala takes the readers through her journey from a suburban Utah life to Hollywood glamour. Openly and vulnerable, she tells stories about her upbringing, failed relationships, Vanderpump Rules filming, sobriety, meeting her fiance Randall Emmett, and more. Give Them Lala is a nice and easy read that was entertaining and funny. I\'m glad I read it, but it does not reach the top of the list for me. I think the book misses a quality story line and some important points for the reader. Maybe the book was written too early in her life and career.',
